#### TO DO: 
- Add nix ide settings to vscode
- Add controls for laptop (brigthness, keyboard, easy monitor switching, battery)
- modularize the config for multiple hosts/options
- automate install (maybe look into nixos anywhere)
- Configure rofi

#### Known issues: 
- zen/firefox doesn't follow cursor theme

#### Non-breaking issues / notes:
- Vscode catppuccin icon extension needs to be above other icons,  
otherwise it breaks. Idk why ([Possible cause](https://github.com/catppuccin/vscode/issues/415))

### Installation:

Before booting into live usb:

Fork this repo to your own public github

Change the username (replace all instances of "vova" with your own username)  
Optional: Change the hostname, default is "desktop"

In NixOS minimal (no gui live cd):  

In tty, run these commands to enter a shell with git and download the config

```
nix-shell -p git
git clone "https://github.com/<YourUsername>/<YourFork>.git"
```
Run this command to replace the hardware config file with your system info (it is autogenerated)

```
nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > ./<YourFork>/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
```
Using vim or nano, delete all the file system information from ./<YourFork>/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix

```
sudo vim ./<YourFork>/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
```

Run disko to partition drive according the config (reminderL default hostname is "desktop")
```
sudo nix --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" run github:nix-community/disko -- --mode disko --flake ./<YourFork>#<hostname>
```
In tty install nixos according to flake (will ask you to set root password)

```
sudo nixos-install --flake ./<YourFork>#<hostname>"
```

Reboot and login to root (username is root). Then set password for your user

```
sudo passwd yourUserName
```
Congrats! You are done
